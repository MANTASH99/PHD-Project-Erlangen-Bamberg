I went home and spoke with my child and he completely denied the allegations and i believed him. I was seething all weekend and by the Monday she contacted me and asked if we could sort things out.

Yet other personalities wanted to have representation on the managing committee based on their friendships, not on the process of the co op. The irony was that I wanted to pass on the role anyway, but doing so in such an abrupt way was irresponsible as well as the obvious deception and disregard for all my hard work.

boredom	within my relationship with someone who was unmotivated for life and kept making the same mistakes	
boredom	I felt ... when I was hanging out alone this past weekend.	
boredom	I felt ... in a relationship a number of years ago. I was seeing a man for 4 years and we were very much in love. And then things changed. He went from being someone who I used to have fun with, laugh with, chat to all the time to someone who was completely focused on work, focused on making money, focused on the future and I no longer enjoyed being with him. However, because I had been with him for so long I stayed with him for another couple of months even though I no longer was happy in the relationship. During that time it seemed like every time we saw each other, I got nothing out of the encounter. All he would talk about was work (he was a lawyer) and football. Neither law or football hold any interest for me. It just seemed like everything that had initially brought us together had been removed and I was so ... and fed up with him. Unfortunately he didn't feel the same way and when I finished things he was absolutely devastated but for me, it was like starting a new life.	
boredom	I felt ... waiting in the doctors surgery. They were running behind on appointments so I had to wait there what felt like a long time.
